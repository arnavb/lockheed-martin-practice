Introduction

In baseball statistics, the slugging percentage (SLG) is a popular measure of the power of a hitter.  You will be given a list of players and their at-bats for a single game.  You will need to compute each player’s slugging percentage.  For this exercise, no player will be hit by a pitch.

The slugging percentage is found by counting all the singles, doubles, triples, and home runs in a given game and applying a set weight to each achievement (home runs are worth more than singles), then dividing that number by the total number of at-bats in that game as shown here:



Program Input

The first line of the file Prob07.in.txt will contain a positive integer T denoting the number of test cases that follow.  Each test case will have the following input:

•	A single line of input per player consisting of the batter’s name, a colon, and some number of at-bats separated by commas.

A player’s at bats can be any of the following:

•	BB means the player was walked by the pitcher and does NOT count as an at-bat.
•	K is an at-bat where the player struck out and did not reach a base.
•	1B is an at-bat where the player hit a single.
•	2B is an at-bat where the player hit a double.
•	3B is an at-bat where the player hit a triple.
•	HR is an at-bat where the player hit a home run.

Please note that not every player in the game has the same number of at bats.  If a player has no at-bats, then their slugging percentage should be 0.

Example Input:

4
Moreland:K,2B,1B,HR
Andrus:BB,BB,2B,K
Chirinos:1B,1B,3B
Odor:1B,K,3B

Program Output

For each test case, your program should output the player’s name, as it appeared in the input, an equal sign and then their slugging percentage rounded to 3 decimal places, no spaces.  Use the standard Code Quest rounding rules found in Appendix A.

Example Output:

Moreland=1.750
Andrus=1.000
Chirinos=1.667
Odor=1.333
