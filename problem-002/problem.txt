Input File:  Prob02.in.txt

Introduction

Sometimes when we type we just miss letters.  Other times we go to a programming competition and we’re asked to remove letters from perfectly good words.

Your task is to write a program which given a String and an integer will print a new String missing the character at the given place.

Program Input

The first line of the file Prob02.in.txt will contain a positive integer T denoting the number of test cases that follow.  Each test case will have the following input:

	•	A single line containing a word, then a space, then a positive integer.  The integer tells us which character to remove from the string, and is 0-based (meaning that a 0 means take away the first letter).  The index given will always be valid – no tricks here!

Example Input:

4
puppy 0
kitten 4
fish 1
dog 2

Program Output

Your program should print the new word with the appropriate character missing.

Example Output:

uppy
kittn
fsh
do
