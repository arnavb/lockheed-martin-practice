Input File:  Prob10.in.txt

Introduction

The home keys on a keyboard are imperative to quick typing if you are a touch typist, but what if you are off just one key?  Imagine you accidentally placed your left index finger at D instead of F and your right index finger at H instead of J.  Translate the following message as if you were retyping it with the wrong home key finger placement.

Program Input

The first line of the file Prob10.in.txt will contain a positive integer T denoting the number of test cases that follow.  Each test case will have the following input:

•	The first line of each test case will be a positive integer N denoting how many lines of text the message contains.
•	The next N lines will contain the message that needs to be translated.

Input Constraints:
•	The input messages will be case sensitive.  Since Shift is a wide key, the wrong hand placement has no effect on pressing that key.
•	Your typing boundaries are:
o	Top row: from Q to P
o	Middle row: from A to L
o	Bottom row: from Z to .
o	There will be no numbers

Program Output
Your program should print out what would appear if your hands were off one place to the left.  Here are some assumptions:
•	Caps Lock starts out being off for each new test case.  Notice that attempting to hit the A key with your hands in the wrong place will turn caps lock on and off.  Shift-Caps Lock is the same as just hitting Caps Lock (in case there is a capital A in the original message).
•	Tabs should be output as 4 spaces, not a real tab.
