Input File:  Prob05.in.txt

Introduction

A local charity has hired you to help organize their lists of donors.  The organization has a list of people who donated to the organization last year, and another list of this year’s donors.  The group wants to send emails to three groups of people:

	•	People who donated last year but didn’t this year
	•	People who donated both years
	•	People who donated this year but didn’t last year

Each group will receive a different email, so they need to know which donors belong to each group.
